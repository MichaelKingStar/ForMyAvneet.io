                I want you to know I love you so incredibly much. I really hope you
                know exactly how much I truly do. So to show that, I wanted to make this for you.
                All of this was made with love by me and I really hope you like how it all looks! :)
                I don't think I can ever get enough of saying I love you and showing it to you darling!
            </p>
            <p class="loveLetter__paragraph">
                First off I need to be honest and say that it took it's time to get this to look how I wanted
                it to. Most of my time was spent looking at tutorials on how to correctly use the different elements
                of making a website. What was the most time consuming out of all of this has to be getting the scripts
                controlling the reasons and all the logic behind this working correctly and then getting the look just right.
            </p>
            <p class="loveLetter__paragraph">
                Secondly, it was a joy making this for you, I really hope it brings you a lot of happiness as well as a way
                to still hear me and everything if you miss me too much. :) Another thing I want to add is that I'm gonna update
                this more as we go, I can tell you when I update it so you can check it out! I have more planned for this as well
                just so you know about it cutie! Love you so much my Avneet! :)

                So to use this correctly, you need to scroll down all the way till you see a pink button.
                This button will give you a new quote, completely different from the last. If you want to
                hear me, you can press the play button on the audio player. Also so you know, this audio player
                works the same way as if you were playing music, so you can stop it same way as you play and stop
                music :)
